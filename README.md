##  Assessment Overview
A Java Swing application that can display, move, and rotate filled and outlined shapes.
Implementation will involve the concepts of Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstract Classes and 
Interfaces.

Notes:
Java Swing Requirements can be satisfied using a JFrame containing a JPanel, with a 
MouseAdapter listener that handles mousePressed events (and overriding the 
paintComponent() method for Shape and String drawing). There are no requirements for 
additional UI elements such as JButtons.
